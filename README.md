# Deep-Learning

Deep Learning Projects for Coursera Deep Learning Specialization. 

* Build and train deep neural networks, identify key architecture parameters, implement vectorized neural networks and deep learning to applications.
* Train test sets, analyze variance for DL applications, use standard techniques and optimization algorithms, and build neural networks in TensorFlow
* Build a CNN and apply it to detection and recognition tasks, use neural style transfer to generate art, and apply algorithms to image and video data
* Build and train RNNs, work with NLP and Word Embeddings, and use HuggingFace tokenizers and transformer models to perform NER and Question Answering
